        <h2>Who is writing?</h2>
        <p>Hey there! We are James and Cristina, two adventurous souls who are passionate about exploring the world. We thrive on discovering new places, diving deep into diverse cultures, and connecting with locals on ground. For us, travel is not a tick list – it's about creating meaningful connections, sharing stories, and collecting unforgettable moments along the way.</p>

        <p>Our journey is all about embracing the beauty of difference. We believe that the more we immerse ourselves in unique experiences, the more vibrant the world becomes. Each place we visit, each new face we meet, adds another layer to our understanding of the world and of each other. It's through these encounters that we discover the undiscovered colours of life, blending cultures, traditions, and stories to create a richer, more beautiful journey.</p>
        
        <p>We’re excited to share our travels with you – the highs, the challenges, the lessons, and the joy of embracing the unknown. Join us as we continue to wander, explore, and celebrate the beauty of our diverse world.</p>
